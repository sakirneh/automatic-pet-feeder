BCU innovation project - group project - Automatic Pet Feeder with RFID
this upload is purely the code, not the AI model or the setup with raspberry pi.

The setup was a raspberry pi 4 model b, 2 dc motors, 1 motor controller board, 1 9v battery, and an RFID scanner with 2 tags ( 1 for dogs 1 for cats).
YOLO AI was used for identification.
